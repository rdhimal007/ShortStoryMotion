"The deity was furious and it cursed the greedy man and his family. The cursed family lost their wealth \nas the days went by," +
"and family members started to die one after another.", "These made everyone in the village and the tribe paranoid and isolated." +

    "got together as one tribe and formed a 'Dhimal Samaj'\n to help each other. A foundation to help each other in need " +
    " was established to provide manpower,\n tools and financial support during all the ceremonies. This community established at 1800 still exists today."];
